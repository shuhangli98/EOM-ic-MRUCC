# EOM-ic-MRUCC
This is a pilot implementation of the Equation-of-Motion internally contracted Multireference Unitary Coupled-Cluster (EOM-ic-MRUCC) theory. (See [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17421))

The code is based on [Forte](https://github.com/evangelistalab/forte).

## Current capabilities
- Availability of both unitary and non-unitary versions.
- Baker–Campbell–Hausdorff (BCH) expansion truncation at a specified number of commutators.
